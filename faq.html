        <h2>Does Kayak have .dbc support?</h2>
        <p>
            No it does not and probably will never have. The .dbc file format is a proprietary format of the
            <i>Vector Informatik GmbH</i> and they want to make money with it. I don't want to be sued for 
            reverse engineering the format. Kayak is open source so if you need support for .dbc develop a
            plugin on your own.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How do I write my own network definitions?</h2>
        <p>
        Kayak uses the .kcd file format for network definitions. There is not yet an editor in Kayak
        but they can be written by hand using the 
        <a href="https://github.com/dschanoeh/Kayak/blob/master/Kayak-kcd/src/main/resources/com/github/kayak/canio/kcd/schema/Definition.xsd">schema</a>
        and the 
        <a href="https://github.com/dschanoeh/Kayak/blob/master/Kayak-kcd/src/test/resources/can_definition_sample.kcd">example</a> 
        as a reference.
        </p>

        <h2>Which CAN hardware is supported?</h2>
        <p>
            Kayak supports all hardware that is supported by SocketCAN. The list is quite large and
            constantly changing. You can find some information in 
            <a href="http://jansblog.org/?p=1025">my blog post</a> or
            <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob_plain;f=drivers/net/can/Kconfig;hb=HEAD">in the Linux kernel source</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Why didn't you use Java JNI?</h2>
        <p>
            I think JNI is something that should be avoided if possible. Your code tends to get ugly and you can
            easily run into various problems.<br/>
            The new attempt in Kayak was choosen because it has some advantages and creates new possibilities
            how you can set up your infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2>Can the socketcand be extended with high level protocols like ISO-TP?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes this is possible. Currently there are no attempts in this direction but it should be quite simple to implement.
        </p>
        <h2>Does the .kcd network definition format handle multiplex messages?</h2>
        <p>Yes!</p>

        <h2>Is it possible to use Kayak and the socketcand on a Windows only machine with a VM?</h2>
        <p>It is possible to run the socketcand and the SocketCAN backend in a virtual machine and connect to this machine with Kayak. The performance may not be the best but you can do this...</p>


        <h2>Is Kayak able to send messages on the CAN-bus</h2>
        <p>Yes sending is possible via the <i>Send view</i></p>

        <h2>Does Kayak support filtering (or event triggering) by frame content (e.g. vehicle speed > 100km/h)</h2>
        <p>No this is not yet possible but it should be fairly simple to implement in a plugin.</p>
